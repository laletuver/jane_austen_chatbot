CHAWTON, Nov. 21, 1814.

MY DEAR ANNA,--I met Harriet Benn yesterday. She gave me her
congratulations, and desired they might be forwarded to you, and there
they are. The chief news from this country is the death of old Mrs.
Dormer. Mrs. Clement walks about in a new black velvet pelisse lined
with yellow, and a white bobbin net veil, and looks remarkably well in
them.

I think I understand the country about Hendon from your description. It
must be very pretty in summer. Should you know from the atmosphere that
you were within a dozen miles of London? Make everybody at Hendon admire
"Mansfield Park."

                                    Your affectionate aunt,       J. A.
