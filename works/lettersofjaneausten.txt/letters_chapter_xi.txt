STEVENTON, Friday (December 28).

MY DEAR CASSANDRA,--Frank is made. He was yesterday raised to the rank
of Commander, and appointed to the "Petterel" sloop, now at Gibraltar. A
letter from Daysh has just announced this, and as it is confirmed by a
very friendly one from Mr. Mathew to the same effect, transcribing one
from Admiral Gambier to the General, we have no reason to suspect the
truth of it.

As soon as you have cried a little for joy, you may go on, and learn
further that the India House have taken _Captain Austen's_ petition into
consideration,--this comes from Daysh,--and likewise that Lieutenant
Charles John Austen is removed to the "Tamar" frigate,--this comes from
the Admiral. We cannot find out where the "Tamar" is, but I hope we
shall now see Charles here at all events.

This letter is to be dedicated entirely to good news. If you will send
my father an account of your washing and letter expenses, etc., he will
send you a draft for the amount of it, as well as for your next quarter,
and for Edward's rent. If you don't buy a muslin gown now on the
strength of this money and Frank's promotion, I shall never forgive
you.

Mrs. Lefroy has just sent me word that Lady Dorchester meant to invite
me to her ball on January 8, which, though an humble blessing compared
with what the last page records, I do not consider as any calamity.

I cannot write any more now, but I have written enough to make you very
happy, and therefore may safely conclude.

                                     Yours affectionately,      JANE.

  Miss AUSTEN, Godmersham Park.
