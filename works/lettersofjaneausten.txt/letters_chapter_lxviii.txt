MY DEAR ANNA,--Cassy desires her best thanks for the book. She was quite
delighted to see it. I do not know when I have seen her so much struck
by anybody's kindness as on this occasion. Her sensibility seems to be
opening to the perception of great actions. These gloves having appeared
on the pianoforte ever since you were here on Friday, we imagine they
must be yours. Mrs. Digweed returned yesterday through all the
afternoon's rain, and was of course wet through; but in speaking of it
she never once said "it was beyond everything," which I am sure it must
have been. Your mamma means to ride to Speen Hill to-morrow to see the
Mrs. Hulberts, who are both very indifferent. By all accounts they
really are breaking now,--not so stout as the old jackass.

                                  Yours affectionately,       J. A.
