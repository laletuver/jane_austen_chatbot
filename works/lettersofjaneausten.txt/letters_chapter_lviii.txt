MY DEAR ANNA,[31]--I am very much obliged to you for sending your MS. It
has entertained me extremely; indeed all of us. I read it aloud to your
grandmamma and Aunt Cass, and we were all very much pleased. The spirit
does not droop at all. Sir Thos., Lady Helen, and St. Julian are very
well done, and Cecilia continues to be interesting in spite of her being
so amiable. It was very fit you should advance her age. I like the
beginning of Devereux Forester very much, a great deal better than if he
had been very good or very bad. A few verbal corrections are all that I
felt tempted to make; the principal of them is a speech of St. Julian to
Lady Helen, which you see I have presumed to alter. As Lady H. is
Cecilia's superior, it would not be correct to talk of her being
introduced. It is Cecilia who must be introduced. And I do not like a
lover speaking in the 3rd person; it is too much like the part of Lord
Overtley, and I think it not natural. If you think differently, however,
you need not mind me. I am impatient for more, and only wait for a safe
conveyance to return this.

                                      Yours affectionately,
                                                         J. A.
