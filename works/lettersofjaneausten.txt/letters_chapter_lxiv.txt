HANS PLACE, Nov. 28, 1814.

MY DEAR ANNA,--I assure you we all came away very much pleased with our
visit. We talked of you for about a mile and a half with great
satisfaction; and I have been just sending a very good report of you to
Miss Benn, with a full account of your dress for Susan and Maria.

We were all at the play last night to see Miss O'Neil in "Isabella." I
do not think she was quite equal to my expectations. I fancy I want
something more than can be. I took two pocket-handkerchiefs, but had
very little occasion for either. She is an elegant creature, however,
and hugs Mr. Young delightfully. I am going this morning to see the
little girls in Keppel Street. Cassy was excessively interested about
your marriage when she heard of it, which was not until she was to drink
your health on the wedding-day.

She asked a thousand questions in her usual manner, what he said to you
and what you said to him. If your uncle were at home he would send his
best love, but I will not impose any base fictitious remembrances on
you; mine I can honestly give, and remain

                                        Your affectionate aunt,
                                                          J. AUSTEN.
